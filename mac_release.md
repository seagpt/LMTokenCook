## Overview üìñ
LMTokenCook is your AI power-user‚Äôs tool for maximizing the value of web interface‚Äìbased, large-context-window language models. It compiles your data into a single master text file (with a map of the file hierarchy and token counts) and divides it into manageable "servings" for easy, sequential pasting into LLMs like Gemini, GPT-4, Claude, and more.
