## README Roast Pass

Roasted with [https://github.com/hidai25/readme-roast](https://github.com/hidai25/readme-roast) on 2026-06-25. This block is evidence-only: repo metadata, root files, and the existing README were scanned before writing.

### Fast roast

- Pre-pass README score: **100/100** by the readme-roast categories: first impression, install friction, trust, visuals, and structure.
- README already had the basics; this pass adds a visual map and sharper operator scan.
- Biggest fix in this pass: added a Mermaid repo map plus a quick operator scan without deleting the existing README content.

### Mermaid repository map

  R --> MORE["additional repo files"]
```

### Operator quick scan

| Signal | Evidence |

| GitHub repo | [DropShock-Digital/LMTokenCook](https://github.com/DropShock-Digital/LMTokenCook) |
| Description | Parse Your Files to Bypass Prompt Window Limits |
| Default branch | `main` |
| Primary languages | TypeScript 73%, Python 24%, Dockerfile 1%, CSS 1%, JavaScript 1% |
| Install path | `python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Run/build hint | Not detected from root files |
| Key files scanned | requirements.txt, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, README.md, src/ |

### README next upgrades

- Add real screenshots, GIFs, or CLI output once the repo has a stable demo path.
- Pin exact setup commands after verifying them in a clean environment.
- Link production/staging/docs only when the URL is durable and intended for readers.

## 🧐 Why LMTokenCook?

In the era of **Context-Augmented Generation (CAG)**, simply pasting code isn't enough. You need **precision**.

Most AI engineers struggle with context windows. "Paste this file" turns into "Content too long." `LMTokenCook` solves this by treating your codebase like a dataset. It recursively scans your repository, counts tokens in real-time, and **intelligently segments** your code into "servings" that perfectly max out your chosen LLM's context window (e.g., 28k for ChatGPT, 60k for Gemini).

> "I couldn't paste 100k tokens of data into ChatGPT. So I built the workflow patching script that evolved into this tool."

## 🚀 Features

*   **🧠 Smart Context Headers**: Every chunk includes a header explaining *exactly* which file it came from and which part (e.g., "Part 1 of 3"), preserving model context retention.
*   **🔒 Local-First & Private**: Powered by the **File System Access API**. Your code is processed entirely in your browser or local Docker container. No cloud uploads.
*   **⚔️ Dual-Head Architecture**:
    *   **Browser Mode (Glaze)**: Instant, zero-setup processing via WebAssembly.
    *   **Server Mode (Iron)**: A FastAPI backend for heavy-duty, headless automation and statistics tracking.
*   **📊 Token Analytics**: Visualize the "weight" of your repository before you even start cooking.
*   **🐋 Docker Ready**: One command (`docker-compose up`) spins up the entire stack, including a secure Cloudflare Tunnel for remote access.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Option 1: The "Power-User" (Docker) 🐳
The recommended way to run. Spins up the Frontend, Backend, Nginx Proxy, and Cloudflare Sidecar.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DropShock-Digital/LMTokenCook.git
cd LMTokenCook
docker-compose up --build
```

> **Access**: Open `http://localhost:5173`.
> **Public**: Check container logs for your unique `https://*.trycloudflare.com` URL.

### Option 2: The "Contributor" (Local Dev) 💻
Run the stack natively for debugging or contributing.

**Backend (Python):**
```bash
# In /src/server
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Frontend (React):**
```bash
# In /src/ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🧩 Architecture

LMTokenCook follows a **Dual-Head Monolith** pattern. See [STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md) for a deep dive into the folder structure.

## ⚙️ How It Works

<details>
<summary><strong>See the Data Flow (Click to Expand)</strong></summary>

### The "Local Cook" Loop
1.  **Selection**: You pick a folder via the browser's native file picker.
2.  **Access**: The browser grants read-only access to that specific directory.
3.  **Scan**: The app recursively walks the tree, ignoring patterns in `.dockerignore`.
4.  **Tokenization**: An in-browser WASM tokenizer (TikToken) calculates weight.
5.  **Chunking**: The algorithm slices files at line breaks to fill the `Target Context Window` (e.g., 28,000 tokens).
6.  **Serving**: Resulting text files are zipped and offered for download.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant B as Browser (FSA API)
    participant W as WebWorker (TikToken)
    participant D as Disk (Local)

    U->>B: Select Input Folder
    B->>D: Request Read Permission
    D-->>B: Permission Granted
    
    loop Recursively Scan
        B->>D: Read File
        D-->>B: Content
    end

    B->>W: Send Content for Tokenizing
    W-->>B: Return Chunks + Stats
    
    B->>D: Write "Cooked" Files (Zip/Folder)
    B->>U: Show "Cooking Complete"
```
</details>

## 🧪 Testing & CI/CD

We maintain a rigorous standard of code quality.

*   **Linting**: Strict `flake8` implementation for Python.
*   **Testing**: `pytest` suite covers the core chunking logic to ensure no data loss.
*   **CI**: GitHub Actions run on every push to `main`.

Run tests locally:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```
